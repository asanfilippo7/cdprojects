	FROM: Black Dot</p><p>
	 	TIME: 1:02 p.m. and 8 p.m.</strong></p><p>This morning Martese Johnson emerged with a head injury requiring 10 stitches.</p>

<p>He was brutalized by Virginia ABC law enforcement outside of Trinity Irish Pub. His face was bloodied. His body was bruised.</p>

<p>Outside of the doors of Trinity Irish Pub, a mass of University students bore witness to the officer's animalistic, insensitive, and brute handling of Martese. He was left with his blood splattered on the pavement of University Avenue.</p>
<p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p><p>Today, we are reminded of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice; as University students, we are not impervious to the brutality that has reeled on news cycles around the country.  We have marched and shouted that we are Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, but the proximity of this morning's brutality to a member of our community has deepened that wound. It is no longer happening only on national television--it is a reality here and now at the University of Virginia that we must face as a collective.</p>

<p>After Martese was denied entry to the bar, he found himself suddenly flung to the ground. The brutish force used resulted in his head and bodily injuries. His treatment was unprovoked as he did not resist questioning or arrest. In confusion, with blood painting his face and creating a pool on the bricks of the corner, he yelled out for mercy.</p>

<p>Though he lay bleeding and crying out, officers continued to hold him to the pavement, pinning him down, twisting his arm, with knees to his back until he was handcuffed.
As students pleaded with officers to lift Martese from the ground they were pushed away, and some were even handcuffed and threatened with possible arrest if they did not leave the scene.</p>

<p>We demand there be a swift and thorough investigation on the state, local, and University levels. We have seen what happens at the University when we allow problems we have long known exist to be handled quietly, so we will not be quiet. We demand noise from each other, noise from professors, noise from administrators. Martese, like any other student at this university, like any other person in this country and in this world, deserves more than our uproar: he deserves follow through and intentional action.</p>

<p>Look forward to a follow up email regarding further plans and actions.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Concerned Black Students</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up: 8 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do, and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority, but to their inhumanity and fear.” - James Baldwin, “A Letter to My Nephew"</strong></p>

<p>Black students, please join us this evening at 8:00 in Clark 108 to express your feelings and concerns about this and your own experiences; to voice your hurts and your hopes; and to come together in our trusted community to discuss ways of fixing the community of trust at the university and larger levels. </p>

<p>More than anything, tonight is a time to come together in celebration of black love: the love of our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and friends; our love of the many black people that we will never meet, but that we, through a shared history, feel kinship with all the same; 
our love of Martese,
and our love of each other.</p>

	<strong>FROM: Latino Student Alliance</p><p>TIME: 4:56 p.m.</strong></p>
	 	,<p>To The University Community, </p>

<p>As many may have heard by now, last night a vile act of police brutality happened to one of our own highly esteemed UVa peers, Martese Johnson. </p>

	<p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p><p>Last night's incident represents nothing short of a perversion of the law enforcement's professed duty to "protect and serve" our community. The use of excessive force and discriminatory detainment by Virginia ABC law enforcement is a chilling reminder that racism is still firmly present in our society, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of our country's justice system. The brutalization of a University student just off grounds reminds us that the criminalization of young black men occurs even within our own privileged University community.</p>

<p>As an organization that strives to promote the rights and redress the grievances of racial minority groups, The Latino Student Alliance stands in solidarity with Martese, his family and the greater Black community. To allow last night's heinous events to go unaddressed would be an egregious error on the part of the University and greater Charlottesville community, a subversion of justice by the local police force, and a grave disservice to Martese and the larger Black community.</p>

<p>We encourage anyone receiving this message to join us as we stand in solidarity with the Black community tonight at 8 pm in Clark Room 108. For information on developing events please visit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bsaatuva" target="_blank">Black Student Alliance’s Facebook page.</a></p>

	<strong>FROM: University President Teresa Sullivan</p><p>
	 	TIME: 5:12 p.m.</strong></p><p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:
 
<p>I write to express my deep concern about an incident that occurred on The Corner early this morning and to provide information about immediate steps that I have taken in response. </p>
 
<p>At about 12:45 a.m., one of our students was injured while Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) agents were attempting to take him into custody on the sidewalk in front of Trinity Irish Pub. University Police and Charlottesville Police arrived on the scene shortly after the incident occurred. We have not yet clarified all of the details surrounding this event, but we are seeking to do so as quickly as possible. </p><p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p><p>This morning I met with Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo and University Police Chief Mike Gibson in an effort to learn more about the incident. Furthermore, because ABC is a state agency, I contacted the Governor's office to ask for an independent investigation of the incident. In response, the Governor has asked the Secretary of Public Safety to initiate an independent Virginia State Police investigation into the use of force in this matter.</p>
 
<p>As the investigation unfolds, eyewitnesses will play an essential role in shedding light on the details of this incident. I urge students and other members of our community who witnessed the incident or have other direct knowledge of it to come forward. Please contact the Virginia State Police at 804-674-2000 immediately.</p>
 
<p>The safety and security of our students will always be my primary concern, and every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence. Today, as U.Va. students, faculty, and staff who share a set of deeply held values, we stand unified in our commitment to seeking the truth about this incident.  And we stand united in our belief that equal treatment and equal justice are among our fundamental rights under the law.</p>

</p><p>TIME: 547 p.m.</strong></p><p>
	 	TIME: Email sent Thursday, Nov. 20 to all sorority women at the University</p><p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>We are outraged by the brutality against a University of Virginia undergraduate student that occurred in the early hours Wednesday, March 18, 2015.  This African American male student was injured on the Corner, after being stopped by Virginia Department of Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) officers. His head was slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force. The student required medical evaluation and treatment at the UVa Hospital Emergency Department.  This was wrong and should not have occurred. In the many years of our medical, professional and leadership roles at the University, we view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.   </p> <p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p><p>This incident is now being handled at the highest level of the University and the State of Virginia. We have spoken with student leaders and are sensitive to the collective remorse and reactions of the University and community.  We are asking everyone to exercise sound judgment and discretion, as we seek to protect the student's rights and privacy.   The Office for Diversity and Equity and the Office of African-American Affairs (OAAA) are available to provide support. This evening, the Office of African-American Affairs (OAAA) will be open until 8:00 pm to provide support.  As we wait to learn more about what happened last night, please know you can call us to talk about this situation and your concerns.</p>
<p>Violence against an individual, no matter the color of his or her skin, gender, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation, is inexcusable and appalling. If you are the victim of bias, racism, hazing, or sexual misconduct please report the incident to the Just Report It system available at http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/. Our students have the right to a safe environment in which to obtain their education. We are deeply concerned about the safety of all students, faculty, staff, and community members.</p>

	<strong>FROM: Black Student Alliance</p><p>TIME: 6:07 p.m.</strong></p><p>In light of the recent events that have transpired in the past day, the Black Student Alliance supports the members of The Black Dot group in their call for a mass meeting in Clark Hall 108, at 8pm tonight. We, like any good-hearted person in our community, are hurting right now. We are saddened; we are angry; and we are searching for answers. All of our feelings are valid. </p>
 
<p>IIn a situation like this the first step in a traumatizing experience is to provide support and love for those affected. Martese is a student; he is an active community member; he is a cousin; and a brother; and a son. He was treated like no one, four-legged or otherwise, should be, and this meeting is a chance to reaffirm his humanity.</p><p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p><p>It is also important to recognize that could have been any of us. Martese was in an area in which we have all at some point been. He was abused in the worst way in an area that, due to recent safety concerns, has increased security. Martese was not secure, and we may not have been, either.</p>
 
<p>Lastly, it is essential that at this time all those who are concerned, sad, angry, hurt, confused, or otherwise come together as a collective to ensure that we are uniform in our understanding of what has occurred, so that any further action we take is informed and fruitful action. </p>
 
<p>With all this in mind, Martese has requested the presence of his friends and his allies in this matter at tonight’s meeting. Following the open sharing segment of the meeting, there will be a discourse regarding where we go from here. Today, we are ALL concerned black students, and so we hope to see you all in attendance.</p>

	FROM: Daniel P. Watkins, Johnson's attorney at Williams Mullen</p><p>
	 	TIME: 7:13 p.m.</strong></p><p>Williams Mullen has released the following statement by Daniel P. Watkins regarding his client, University of Virginia student Martese Johnson:</p>

<p>On March 18, 2015, Charlottesville Police charged 20-year old Martese Johnson with two misdemeanors: 1) obstruction of justice without force and 2) profane swearing and/or intoxication in public. The charges were filed after a Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) officer and local police confronted Mr. Johnson near "the Corner,"" a popular off-campus social hub near the University of Virginia. Contrary to early police reports, Mr. Johnson has not been accused of possessing false identification.</p>

<p>
	<details><summary><strong>Click to Read More</strong></summary></p>

<p>"Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head," Mr. Watkins said. "This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese's physical wounds are beginning to heal."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson is a third-year student at the University of Virginia, double majoring in Italian and Media Studies. He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record.</p>

<p>As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future," Mr. Watkins said. "I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson and his family ask that the media respect his privacy at this time and direct any further questions to his attorney, Daniel Watkins, with Williams Mullen. The investigation is still in its early stages, and Mr. Watkins and Williams Mullen are limited in what information can be shared with the media.</p>

	 	TIME: 24 November, 2014</p><p>
	Dear Rector Martin, members of the Board of Visitors, President Sullivan, Provost Simon, Dean Baucom, Dean Groves, fellow faculty members, students, and alumni, We the undersigned members of the Council of Chairs and Directors in Arts and Sciences call for everyone in the University community to join forces to establish the University of Virginia as a leader in addressing the issues relating to sexual assault and alcohol abuse that plague	universities and colleges across the nation.</p><p class="expand">
	<i class="▲"></i><strong> Click to Read More</strong></p><p class="contract hide">
We call for a comprehensive restructuring of the conditions underlying the persistent culture of sexual assault and alcohol abuse at UVA in order to transform our culture into one more consistent with University ideals of gender equality,diversity, and social justice. We call for actions that collaboratively maximize the strengths of
different parts of the community&mdash;students, faculty, staff, alumni, administrators, and members
of the Board of Visitors. Among the many actions that this ongoing effort must entail, we urge
attention to the following: 
	<br />
1. Restructure the University’s “Terms and Conditions for Contracted Independent Organizations
[CIOs] and Fraternal Organizations [FOs],” one of the primary purposes of which has been to
establish a legal firewall between the University and its CIOs and FOs; and one of the primary
effects of which has been to establish conditions of deniability concerning actions that take place
in CIOs and FOs recognized by the University 
(https://policy.itc.virginia.edu/policy/policydisplay?id=STAF-002). The terms of agreement
between the University and its CIOs and FOs should establish clear grounds for University
oversight of these organizations; clear rules of accountability regarding CIO and FO adherence
to local, state, and federal laws and University Standards of Conduct; and clear consequences for
the violation of these laws and standards. The terms of agreement should also mandate the
immediate suspension of activities of any CIO or FO that is under investigation for sexual
assault.
	<br />
2. Establish policies at all levels and in all units of the University that treat sexual assault as a
criminal offense and that provide trained independent victims’ advocates and legal counsel for
survivors of sexual assault. Work with state legislators to adopt procedures through which
universities and colleges in Virginia are required to develop rigorous and responsible policies
involving sexual assault.
	<br />
3. Acknowledge and work to eradicate the pervasive binge drinking and alcohol abuse at UVA
that are clearly linked to sexual assaults, alcohol poisoning, accidents, and deaths as well as
longer-term physical, psychological, and sexual health problems for our students.

	<br />
Tel: 434-924-7105 • Fax: 434-924-1478 • TDD: 434-982-HEAR
	<br />
4. Fund a public history project that documents the history and culture of sexual assault at the
University of Virginia and that produces an archive of survivors’ accounts of rape at UVA so
that no one can ever again claim ignorance of the extent of its historical and current
manifestations in our community. Use this resource center productively to inform ongoing
efforts to reform the culture of sexual assault that pervades life at UVA and other university and
college campuses.
	<br />
5. Dedicate significant on-going resources to support existing and emergent student, university,
and community organizations that educate students, faculty, and administrators on these issues;
that provide historical and ethnographic research documenting and analyzing the larger nationwide
culture of sexual assault; that establish systems of peer mentoring (especially between first
year and upper class women); and/or that work to change the culture of sexual assault and
alcohol abuse at UVA.
	<br />
6. Create alternative, safe spaces for student residence and socialization that foster responsible
and meaningful citizenship in the UVA community and beyond. Convene a group of students,
faculty, and administrators to discuss the future of residential life at the university.
	<br />
7. Reflect on our own actions and commitments in regard to the structures of inequality that
underlie this ongoing crisis. Dedicate ourselves to creating an environment in which all our
students can flourish.
	<br />
We look forward to working with other members of the UVA community on these pressing
issues over the days, weeks, months, and years ahead.</p></div>

	 	TIME: Thursday, Nov. 20</p><p>
	 	Dear President Sullivan,</p><p>
	 	We were all heartbroken and enraged to read yesterday's Rolling Stone article.  The extreme violence that was reported is shocking and demands an unequivocal response that we will not tolerate violence against our students.</p><p>
	<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.cav/9723_letter_to_president_sullivan_as_of_22novo.pdf" target="_blank">1059 Faculty, Staff, and Students signed in support of this letter</a></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p class="expand">
	<i class="▲"></i><strong> Click to Read More </strong><i class="▲"></i></p><p class="contract hide">
UVA faculty, staff and students have been debating how we might most effectively respond. 
	<br />
As an initial step, we propose a policy that institutes an immediate freeze on activities by any student organizations that are currently under investigation for sexual misconduct and sexual assault. 
	<br />
Further, we call on the Greek System to collectively and voluntarily suspend activities this weekend in light of recent events and out of respect for the victims of sexual violence on our campus.  
	<br />
We believe this immediate action will be an important first step in sending the message that violence against our students will not be tolerated.  It will also send a clear message to fraternities, that if they stand by and fail to intervene in violence, or if they knowingly do not report violence, the activities of your fraternity will be suspended. 
	<br />
We look forward to seeing this important response implemented.

	FROM: Faculty Senate</p><p>
	 	To the Members of the University Community:
From the moment the Rolling Stone article appeared, faculty members from across the Grounds have been expressing shock and outrage. The Executive Council of the Faculty Senate strongly condemns the violent criminal behavior depicted. We urge everyone to approach this situation with sensitivity and sound judgment as the law enforcement investigation process is carried out.</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p class="expand">

Sexual violence is a national epidemic. Faculty members everywhere must play a role in changing the culture that allows violence to occur. We call on our faculty to learn more and to actively participate with the ongoing prevention efforts. We pledge to engage with the administration, staff, students, and alumni to foster a safe community, grounded in dignity and integrity, free of violence.
	<br />
On behalf of the Faculty Senate Executive Council,
	<br />
Joe Garofalo, Chair
Nina Solenski, Chair-Elect
Chris Holstege, Immediate Past Chair
	<br />
This statement has also been endorsed by the General Faculty Council.

	 	We wish that the recent Rolling Stone article regarding the culture of rape in the University’s Greek system had come as a shock. Unfortunately, as students, we are all too familiar with the rape and assault that is ubiquitous on Rugby Road.</p><p class="expand">
